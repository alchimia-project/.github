ALCHIMIA aims at the digitalization of big European metallurgy industries to unlock the full potential of artificial intelligence and support green growth.
The main objective of ALCHIMIA is to ensure the greatest levels of safety, trust, and smooth communication between artificial intelligence-powered industrial solutions and workers in those industries.

## Overall Mission
The Green Deal will make Europe the first climate-neutral continent in the world. To do that, European industries must contribute to a greener and more sustainable Europe, which is specifically recognized in a new policy for a climate-neutral and circular industry.
Among the energy-intensive industries, the metallurgy industry poses a major challenge due to the tradeoff between maintaining economic profitability and progressively implementing the required transformations for greener production.
The mission of the ALCHIMIA project is to provide sustainable and competitive metalworking industries in the EU with a platform to support the transition to high-quality, competitive, efficient, and green production processes with the guarantee of high-quality products in the steel-making industry.
ALCHIMIA will find an optimal mix to reduce energy consumption, emissions, and waste generation in the steel-making process while also guaranteeing the production of high-quality products.

## Outcomes of the ALCHIMIA Project:

- Outcome 1: Implement a decentralized Artificial Intelligence and data solution to support the strategy towards the green transition of European big metallurgy industries.
- Outcome 2: Demonstrate the potential of ALCHIMIA solution automatically to dynamically find the optimal mix needed in steel-making processes based on recycled scrap metal, which will be successfully replicated in automotive parts production.
- Outcome 3: Assess the environmental impact of ALCHIMIA solution
- Outcome 4: Guarantee the highest levels of trust, safety and seamless collaboration between workers and AI-powered industrial solutions.
- Outcome 5: Establish synergies with Artificial intelligence for EU Artificial intelligence on-demand-platform, GAIA-X, European Common Data Spaces and relevant standards
- Outcome 6: Communication and exploitation strategy for the adoption of ALCHIMIA results in several sectors.
